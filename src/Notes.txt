        Throw if
            Resource or Transform has no type - bad input
            Types are not a unique key - duplicated or both

        Build maps of valid resources and transforms
            Resources: type -> ResourceDescriptor
            Transforms: type -> TransformDescriptor
            ResourceBindings: type -> <TransformResourceBindingDescriptor>

        Produce list of warnings for invalid resources and transforms
            UnreferencedResource: Resource {r} is not referenced by any ResourceBinding on any Transform.
            ResourceNotCreated: Resource {r} is not created by any Transform by an output-only ResourceBinding.
            ResourceNotDestroyed: Resource {r} is not destroyed by any Transform by an input-only ResourceBinding.
            ResourceHasNoPredicates: Resource {r} has no predicates. 
            MissingResource: ResourceBinding {rb} on Transform {t} expects type {t} but this type is not described as a resource.
            InvalidPredicate: ResourceBinding {rb} on Transform {t} declares predicate {p} which is not available on resource type {t}.
